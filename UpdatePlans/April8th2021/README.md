# What to talk about (April 8th 2021)

Plans for updating the article (hopefully tomorrow, Friday, April 9th 2021, or a soon later date)

1. Bad project management: 1 app leads to another app with half the functionality, original app gets deleted, new app with 75% less functionality is made, the app with 50% functionality is removed, new app with 87.5% of the functionality is created, app with 75% functionality is discontinued, and so on.

2. Attempts to be pro-privacy and Oxymoron "Google VPN"

3. Android phones phone home over a dozen times per day

4. DRM usage

5. Tax avoidance and other illegal behavior

6. Fines from Europe and the US just being a drop in the bucket (€5,000,000,000 is just a drop-in-the-bucket to them)

7. Steamrolling over Go! (2003) with Go (2009)

8. Chrome dominance and avoiding web standards, Chrome only websites, the new IE6.

9. YouTube monopoly and "Soviet Union stalinist level punishments" towards the whole platform.

10. Horrible platform moderation, bad content, porn and gore for kids, advertisement bot farms, and more. It is almost like there is no moderation at all.

11. Common misconception: Google/Google search is not the Internet, Google search is just a search engine. Kind of like how not every game for a Nintendo platform is made by Nintendo, but is licensed by Nintendo, but to a much greater extent. If all of Googles servers were to be simultaneously destroyed right now, only Google Sites like YouTube, GMail, Google Doscs, Google search, etc. would be gone, but the majority of the Internet would still be there (Wikipedia, Stackoverflow, GitHub, all of Microsofts websites, NYTimes, Samsung, TikTok, etc.) they may lose their Google functionality, but they would still be functional.

12. Google products (such as Google Translate) have stripped functionality on browsers like Firefox.

13. Google doesn't care about a problem until it creates a controversy, then they will make a poor attempt to fix it, just enough for the controversy to temporarily go away, and the problem then gets exponentially worse until it creates another controversy, etc.

14. Google does not care about the performance of their products as of at least 2017, as their last benchmarking software (Google Octane) was discontinued in 2017.

15. A company should not be fully automated. Google is an example of this. Moderation is horrible when done only by AI, YouTube is a good example, even with the extra few (hundreds, or maybe a thousand) people moderating the site, where it is apparently so bad that most of them have to get therapy while working.

16. Open source can't be partial. Google is proof of this. Every bit and byte of the source code must be visible to the public, with not even an 8th of a byte hidden.

17. Google cannot be trusted, and can never be trusted ever again.
