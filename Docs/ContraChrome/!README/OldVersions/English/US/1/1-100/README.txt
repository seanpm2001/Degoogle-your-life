# ContraChrome

I am using this really well made comic book as reference for DeGoogling. I believe it gets all the points across in a manner that most people can understand.

Before publishing, I have read all 30 pages. It is really creative, and goes over all the needed points in a way that even a layman could understand it. That is why I am spreading the word by sharing it here.
