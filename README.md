Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Degoogle-your-life/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

## Basic description

[From Wikipedia: Degoogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle/)

The DeGoogle movement (also called the de-Google movement) is a grassroots campaign that has spawned as privacy activists urge users to stop using Google products entirely due to growing privacy concerns regarding the company. The term refers to the act of removing Google from one's life. As the growing market share of the internet giant creates monopolistic power for the company in digital spaces, increasing numbers of journalists have noted the difficulty to find alternatives to the company's products.

**History**

In 2013, John Koetsier of Venturebeat said Amazon's Kindle Fire Android-based tablet was "a de-Google-ized version of Android." In 2014 John Simpson of US News wrote about the ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù by Google and other search engines. In 2015, Derek Scally of Irish Times wrote an article on how to "De-Google your life." In 2016 Kris Carlon of Android Authority suggested that users of CyanogenMod 14 could ‚Äúde-Google‚Äù their phones, because CyanogenMod works fine without Google apps too. In 2018 Nick Lucchesi of Inverse wrote about how ProtonMail was promoting how to "be able to completely de-Google-fy your life.‚Äù Lifehacker's Brendan Hesse wrote a detailed tutorial on "quitting Google." Gizmodo journalist Kashmir Hill claims that she missed meetings and had difficulties organizing meet ups without the use of Google Calendar. In 2019, Huawei gave a refund to phone owners in the Philippines who were inhibited from using services provided by Google because so few alternatives exist that the absence of the company's products made normal internet use unfeasible.

## Overview by Wuest3nFuchs

A better description, provided by [Wuest3nFuchs](https://github.com/Wuest3nFuchs/) - source: [Wuest3nFuchs/Degoogle](https://github.com/Wuest3nFuchs/Degoogle/)

### What does it mean? by Wuest3nFuchs

[Degoogling means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle) to stop using anything that belongs to Google, anything that was made by Google. I'm talking about their [search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search), their mail service ([Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail), [Youtube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google#YouTube), [etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products).

### Why Degoogle? by Wuest3nFuchs

Google is one of the most powerful companies in the world right now. [They](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/20/what-does-google-know-about-me.html) [have](https://vulcanpost.com/636465/google-personal-info/) stored a huge amount of [information](https://www.security-faqs.com/how-many-ways-does-google-store-your-personal-information.html) [on](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/google-collects-a-frightening-amount-of-data-about-you-you-can-find-and-delete-it-now/) [all](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy) [of](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-sells-future-powered-your-personal-data-n870501) [us](https://www.wired.com/story/google-tracks-you-privacy/). Some would argue that our information is safe with them because they know how to protect it. But this isn't true. Google has been penetrated before and it will be penetrated in the future. Maybe not by some script kiddie but it will be done by a nation state. Google stores personal information on all of us because this is how they make money.

[They scan our emails](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/02/28/google-confirms-new-ai-tool-scans-300-billion-gmail-attachments-every-week/), [store what we search when we're using their search engine](https://www.wired.com/story/google-tracks-you-privacy/), [what videos we watch on Youtube](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/13/technology/personaltech/how-to-make-youtube-stop-watching-what-you-watch.html). This is how they target us and build a profile on us to show us some ad based on what we talked about with our best friend so they can show us an ad for something we need, but this is too creepy. Thanks to [Mr. Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) we now know that Google has shared our personal information with NSA under a program called **"[PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program))"**.


In the future someone will be capable of accessing all that information and I assure you something really [bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) is going to happen. To prevent that from happening, you should start Degoogling right now. Also you shouldn't use products by a company that shares your data with **[NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency)**. You should put a stop to all of this by degoogling.

**If other people can do it, you can do it too.**

Privacy on Google products is always bad, due to all Google products containing spyware.

No matter what you do, when you are using Google, all of your sensitive personal data is being sent to Google and others. Google has also been spotted going through open programs. For example, from personal experience (on Firefox) with a YouTube tab open that I didn't visit, I watched several videos offline (VLC Media Player) Later when I went to check the recommendations, it was nearly everything that I had watched. There is no doubt they are spying on other programs too.

In Chrome (and many other browsers) an incognito mode is present. In Chrome, this mode is pointless, as Google will still mine your data. Even if you turn data mining/tracking off, and enable the "do not track" signal, surprise suprise, Google is still mining your data.

If you think you have nothing to hide, **you are absolutely wrong**. This argument has been debunked many times over:

[Via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument#Criticism)

1. Edward Snowden remarked "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. "When you say, ‚ÄòI have nothing to hide,‚Äô you‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care about this right.‚Äô You‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have this right, because I‚Äôve got to the point where I have to justify it.‚Äô The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights."

2. Daniel J. Solove stated in an article for The Chronicle of Higher Education that he opposes the argument; he stated that a government can leak information about a person and cause damage to that person, or use information about a person to deny access to services even if a person did not actually engage in wrongdoing, and that a government can cause damage to one's personal life through making errors. Solove wrote "When engaged directly, the nothing-to-hide argument can ensnare, for it forces the debate to focus on its narrow understanding of privacy. But when confronted with the plurality of privacy problems implicated by government data collection and use beyond surveillance and disclosure, the nothing-to-hide argument, in the end, has nothing to say."

3. Adam D. Moore, author of Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations, argued, "it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security." He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, sexuality, and religion.

4. Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and cryptographer, expressed opposition, citing Cardinal Richelieu's statement "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged", referring to how a state government can find aspects in a person's life in order to prosecute or blackmail that individual. Schneier also argued "Too many wrongly characterize the debate as 'security versus privacy.' The real choice is liberty versus control."

5. Harvey A. Silverglate estimated that the common person, on average, unknowingly commits three felonies a day in the US.

6. Emilio Mordini, philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is inherently paradoxical. People do not need to have "something to hide" in order to hide "something". What is hidden is not necessarily relevant, claims Mordini. Instead, he argues an intimate area which can be both hidden and access-restricted is necessary since, psychologically speaking, we become individuals through the discovery that we could hide something to others.

7. Julian Assange stated "There is no killer answer yet. Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) has a clever response, asking people who say this to then hand him their phone unlocked and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't be talking to you, and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's going to take you with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth."

8. Ignacio Cofone, law professor, argues that the argument is mistaken in its own terms because, whenever people disclose relevant information to others, they also disclose irrelevant information. This irrelevant information has privacy costs and can lead to other harms, such as discrimination.

## Countering other arguments

There are some arguments people make to justify Google. One of the first major one is already debunked [here](#Privacy) but here are some other ones:

### Convenience

Yes, Google products seem convenient. However, you are trading everything good for convenience, including security, privacy, and reliability. Google has been getting lazier over the years, and their servers have gone down more and more. Right now, the Google servers go down for nearly an hour 1-2 times per month (most notably YouTube)

Unfortunately, due to societies reliance on Google, Google has come to dominate the Internet, and is seeking to control more and more. In 2012, when Google went down for 5 minutes, it was reported that **global** Internet traffic **dropped by 40%** Google frequently goes down for 1-2 hours, and with the [firing of their ethics team](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/google-fires-top-ai-ethics-researcher-margaret-mitchell/) among other things, they are going to become less and less convenient.

Convenience isn't always a good thing. You should be aware of what is going on and be prepared for when they go down, as there isn't a way to have a server not go down every once in a while.

Google also isn't as convenient as you think. There are other much more convenient sites. Google is far from convenient, when you account their random account suspensions and terminations with no response (unless you draw enough attention to the Google twitter account or sue them for $100,000,000 or more) then they have taken advantage of you, screwed you over, and forced you to scream into a pillow, where no-one could hear your screams for help.

### Why does it matter, its too late anyways

This is a less common argument, but it needs explanation. With the current state, most world governments, along with several powerful corporations seem to know your every move, so why even bother to get away from it? The answer is simple: **you deserve better**. If you manage to get away from them at this point, it is harder for them to track your moves further, and you can build a new more private life.

[1 source](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/huk4rp/why_you_should_degoogle_intro_degoogling/) By the way, I have been giving my free Reddit award to this post every time I get it for over a week now (along with all 500 of my free coins) to boost this topic up further. So far, I have given this post over 14 free awards. It isn't much, but small things can make a big impact, depending on how it is perceived, and by whom.

### Other

I don't have any other arguments at the moment.

## My degoogling experience

I finally started to see the problems with big tech in 2018, and I began degoogling. In the first few months, I made significant progress. It slowed down immensely since then.

Google AMP -> Never used

Google VPN -> Never used, also an oxymoron

Google Pay -> Never used

Google Summer of Code -> Never participated

Tenor -> Other GIF sites, although GIFs aren't too important to me. I normally get GIF files from DuckDuckGo images, Imgur, Reddit, or other sites.

Blockly -> No longer used, not sure if Scratch directly ran blockly. I became a functional programmer in 2017 onward, and grew out of Scratch.

GBoard -> Used once, but abandoned

Google Glass -> Never used, considered as a young child but decided not to get one/use one if I had the option

_List may be incomplete._

**June 2021 update:** I have been doing a lot of switching between file services, recently settling back on Google Drive, but due to Chromium sync and dominance, the unsafeness of this method, and the future of Google outside Google Chrome, I forced myself to regain control, and switched back to full SD card backups, with AndrOpen Office replacing Microsoft Word after a few months of problems. Despite the ad festation before I open the document, it is the only way, as I can't use Google, and I can't pay for Microsoft Office. It is the only OpenOffice fork I can find for Android, and I like the interface due to its early 2000s design. Eventually, I will convert my Android phone to an Android virtual machine and probably switch to a PinePhone.

### Products I still cannot get away from

As of February 25th 2021, these are the Google products that are keeping me from fully degoogling:

1. YouTube

2. Android

3. Google Play Store

4. GMail (only for school and some sites)

5. Google Classroom (only for school)

6. Google Translate

7. Google Account

8. Google Sites (as Google is violating the laws of the GDPR (and can face another ‚Ç¨5,000,000.00 fine until they get it fixed) and forbidding downloads of this product)

I have degoogled from everything else.

## Go is evil

Google steamrolled over the 2003 Agent Based programming language `Go!` with their programming language `Go` (from 2009, 6 years later) and claimed that their language wouldn't affect the other language at all. Google was criticized heavily for this, as their `Don't be evil` motto was still active at the time, and this is one of the many incidents that got the don't be evil Motto retired.

In the end, development of `Go!` ceased, while `Go` became more and more common. Google claimed they wouldn't stramroll over `Go!` but in the end, they did, and they got away with it (as of April 9th 2021)

***

## Usage of DRM

Google uses DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) through their WideVine DRM "service" and other forms. The goal of DRM is to destroy the open Internet and give companies monopolistic power over users. You should get rid of WideVine completely, no matter the cost.

[Read more about WideVine and its problems here](https://github.com/Degoogle-your-life/Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM)

## Common misconceptions

This is a list of some common misconceptions with Google products.

### Google is not the Internet

Google/Google search is not the Internet, Google search is just a search engine, kind of like how not every game for a Nintendo platform is made by Nintendo, but is licensed by Nintendo, but to a much greater extent. If all of Googles servers were to be simultaneously destroyed right now, only Google Sites like YouTube, Gmail, Google Docs, Google search, etc. would be gone, but the majority of the Internet would still be there (Wikipedia, Stackoverflow, GitHub, all of Microsofts websites, NYTimes, Samsung, TikTok, etc.) they may lose their Google sign-in and analytical functionality, but they would still be functional (unless they were poorly programmed and relied directly on Google)

***

## Internet Explorer 6 and Chrome

Google Chrome is becoming the new Internet Explorer 6. When Google Chrome originally came out, Firefox was the dominant browser, and had mostly killed off Internet Explorers marketshare (which surpassed 96% before millions of people switched to Firefox and other browsers) when Google Chrome came out, people switched due to its speed and it being by Google (which wasn't considered as evil at the time, as most privacy issues hadn't come to light yet) Google Chrome originally respected web standards (which is what Firefox did that killed off Internet Explorers 96% browser marketshare) however, as Google Chromes marketshare rose, Google began removing more and more features, adding more spyware, and stopped accepting web standards, Google Chrome has become the new Internet Explorer 6.

The major problem right now is websites that are Chrome only, and won't work on other browsers, as their developers decided they didn't want the other 30-40% of Internet users who don't use Chrome to use their site.

Even Google themselves is making their sites Chrome only. For example, Google search will prompt you to download Chrome 3 times every 10 seconds if it detects you are not using Google Chrome (even other Chromium-based browsers such as Brave are affected) and sites like Google Earth don't allow Firefox users to use their site (as of 2020) plus Google Translate does not support voice input on Firefox, and other non-Google Chrome browsers.

### The problem with Brave

Other browsers that are based on Chromium, such as Brave and Microsoft Edge aren't completely free of Google spyware. Brave is commonly recommended by the wrong side of the privacy community, but Brave is still a problem, as it uses Chromium. The Internet shouldn't consist of Chromium only browsers, there should be a variety of choice. Brave is the wrong way to go.

## Faux privacy renewal

Google has been trying to tell the world they care about privacy, after it was already too late. They continue to claim they respect user privacy, but they still aren't fixing all their privacy problems. 

### Open source cannot be partial

Open source can't be partial. Google is proof of this. Every bit and byte of the source code must be visible to the public, with not even an 8th of a byte hidden.

Projects like Android and ChromeOS are partially open source, but contain a majority of proprietary, spyware elements.

### Oxymoron

Google VPN is an oxymoron. Google does not care about privacy, and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) from a company like them would be one of the worst possible choices for a VPN service.

***

## Bad performance

Google does not care about the performance of their products as of at least 2017, as their last benchmarking software (Google Octane) was discontinued in 2017.

***

## Bad project management

Google has a very bad internal project management system. Some common examples of programs that have gotten more and more downgraded include Google Duo and YouTube music (formerly Google Play Music)

In Googles internal development system, 1 app leads to another app with half the functionality, then the original app gets deleted. A couple years later, a new app with 75% less functionality is made, and then the app with 50% functionality is removed, followed by a new app with 87.5% of the functionality being created, then the app with 75% functionality is discontinued, and so on.

***

## Horrible or no moderation of services

YouTube is the most common example in the world of bad moderation creating the worst platform in existence. Google also doesn't seem to get that YouTube isn't YouTube kids.

For YouTube, hateful pro-Nazi and White Supremacist content is served to users for the purpose of more engagement time and more money. Google also has done some very stupid things in their moderation, such as approving a Christian Anal Sex video as content `made for kids` while at the same time age restricting the video. It is also not too uncommon to see pornographic or gore ads being right under the Baby Shark video, along with various other `made for kids` content.

YouTube users complain extremely frequently about the poor moderation on YouTube for bad content (like the examples listed above) while users can get their videos deleted at random for no reason with no ability to repeal, along with users being punished for any form of swearing, even very minor cases like saying `crap` users commonly compare YouTube to the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) in the Stalin era, due to these unequal punishments.

In 2021, Google announced that they will put ads on all videos, despite the video being demonitized (so that Google makes money, but the creator doesn't) this doesn't relate to moderation too much, but it is important to note.

YouTube is moderated (albeit very poorly) but the Google ad service that makes them most of their money seems to have little to no moderation.

[Read more about YouTube moderation issues and how to alternate from YouTube](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Alternating-from-YouTube)

Advertisements for Google Play are generated from bot farms, you can tell by the same ad scenarios being used by hundreds of companies with little changes, and no relation to the product (common examples: Playrix (Homescapes, Gardenscapes) Fishdom, Mafia City, and thousands more) along with a booming malicious trend of ads claiming that users can earn money by playing games, listening to music, etc. PayPal hasn't commented on this, but it is obvious that this is a scam, as if you could make over $10,000 in less than 20 seconds by playing a game guaranteed, nobody would be doing work and would be doing this instead, which is impossible, and a business could not work like this. This obvious scam has been growing strong since 2019, and now the bot farms that produce these ads are fighting with each other in their own ads.

Several advertisements are also very lewd, and attempt to get users (majority of them being users under the age of 13, or bots) to click through sexual manipulation.

Many apps use bots and astroturf their products, so whenever a bad review is made, sock puppet bot accounts will start posting 5 star reviews and attempt to negate your criticism. [Google is doing this themselves as well](#Astroturfing)

[Read more about issues with Google AdSense](https://github.com/Degoogle-your-life/Why-you-should-stop-using-Google-AdSense)

***

## Astroturfing

General definition [(from Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)

```
Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. The term astroturfing is derived from AstroTurf, a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word "grassroots". The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a "true" or "natural" grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a "fake" or "artificial" appearance of support.
```

Google has a history of astroturfing to make it seem like they aren't doing anything evil (in the process, astroturfing is evil) for example, posting critism of Google on a platform like Twitter (which they have an account on) will result in several accounts that have existed for a while but never posted before coming out and claiming that what you said is false, and then claiming that Google is the best company, but done in a way that it may not be obvious that these are bots to most people.

***

## Illegal and unethical business practices

Google uses illegal and unethical business practices to further their monopoly, such as using tax havens, outsourcing jobs, and continuing to do illegal invasive activities as a cost of doing business.

### In Europe

Europe has frequently sued Google, the biggest lawsuit being against illegal behavior in Android, which resulted in Google receiving a ‚Ç¨5,000,000,000 (equivalent to $5,947,083,703.68 in April 9th 2021 money)

### In North America

The United States has not given nearly enough of a fine to Google yet, compared to Europes ‚Ç¨5,000,000,000 fine.

### Controversies

Google doesn't care about a problem until it creates a controversy, then they will make a poor attempt to fix it, just enough for the controversy to temporarily go away, and the problem then gets exponentially worse until it creates another controversy, and the cycle continues. They simply don't care enough to do anything serious about it.

***

## Google is automated

As a company, Google is mostly automated, with less moderation than automation.

A company should not be fully automated. Google is an example of this. Moderation is horrible when done only by AI, YouTube is a good example, even with the extra few (hundreds, or maybe a thousand) people moderating the site, where it is apparently so bad that most of them have to get therapy while working.

***

## Android

Android is owned by Google. Part of the Open Handset Alliance (which hasn't been open since Android) Android has become another monopoly point for Google, and a very hard one to escape.

Android has been reported to phone home to Google at least 10 times per day, and despite being partially open source, it still acts heavily as spyware. 

Several projects have been created to alternate from Android, but require rooting your device. This simply isn't possible anymore for specific Samsung phones in the US, due to the Knox DRM. Common alternates to Android include iOS, iPadOS, LineageOS, Android x86, Ubuntu Touch, and PiPhone (Pi Phone is a brand of phones that run various Linux systems on a mobile device, such as Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, etc.)

## Small actions to help

Spreading awareness in every way you can is important. For me, I not only frequently talk about degoogling, and write articles, but I also have a small little habit, where I give my daily free Reddit award to the pinned post on r/degoogle to raise awareness. So far, I have given nearly 30 awards to the pinned post (I also spent 500 of my free coins on 10 awards for that post) this is called [slacktivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism) which alone isn't too helpful but it can make an impact. If possible, you should also try to get the word out, and do something other than just slacktivism

### Slacktivism

[Slacktivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism) can be good when paired with activism, although if you literally can't be an activist, you can at least be a slacktivist. Slacktivism by itself isn't too helpful, but it can reach out to other people and get them to realize the issue. Although, you should at least try to do something. See below for more info.

### Doing something

If you remain hopeless and closed minded, and decide to not even try to Degoogle, you are only siding with Google and making the problem worse. You don't have to immediately switch from all Google products, most Degooglers slowly fix 1 problem at a time, with weeks to months in between at times.

Here are some helpful links for finding alternatives to Google software:

## Untrustable

Google cannot be trusted, and can never be trusted ever again. They have completely gone from "don't be evil" (they were always evil) to just being completely evil and not trying to hide it.

### Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
